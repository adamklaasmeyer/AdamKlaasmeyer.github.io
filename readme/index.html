This letter is my attempt to warn you about the consequences of your sin if you don&rsquo;t repent and change your ways. This letter is also my attempt to offer you a way out.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am offering this to you Tera because I meant my vows of marriage. Believe it or not I still want the best for you. I forgive you even though you never asked for forgiveness. I asked you to forgive me on the day we got divorced and I&rsquo;m asking you to forgive me again. I offer this to you Annika and Emme because I will always be your father and as I&rsquo;ve always promised you, my heart and home will always be open to you. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All three of you have disowned me for your own reasons but, they are essentially the same reason. That reason is because I insisted on Biblical values for all of you but, you don&#39;t like it. That&rsquo;s why you&#39;re probably going to hate reading this letter too because it&#39;s full of Biblical values. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even demons know that God exists. They just don&#39;t trust God. They don&#39;t repent because it&#39;s too late for them. We still have the choice to repent and trust in Christ.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I have already forgiven all of you even though none of you have asked for it. How is that possible? I&#39;m happier and living a more righteous life than ever even after you disowned me. How is that possible? Jesus.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am following through on my lifetime vow to protect all of you by offering you the gospel in this letter. I&rsquo;m asking you to try forgiveness instead of contempt. I&rsquo;m asking you to repent and turn back towards God.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember when I used to always say build character that turns out to be a biblical value. James 1:2 &quot; my brethren count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. &quot; Romans 5: 3 We also have glory and tribulation, knowing tribulation produces perseverance, and perseverance produces character and character produces hope.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annika and Emme, this letter is also my attempt to offer you a way to switch sides. I have a great job as a Product Designer at hp Inc. and I make exactly $250,000/year now. I can afford to pay for your apartment, tuition at ASU, car etc. here in Scottsdale just as we originally talked about in 2018. Now do you accept my offer to move to Scottsdale?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one can force you to love God. Even God won&#39;t force you to love Him. There is a storm on the way and I&rsquo;m warning all of you to get inside the proverbial ark of the covenant before you find yourself in the flood waters. The fear of God&#39;s perfect judgment is the beginning of wisdom. The purpose of life is to find Christ. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have successfully convicted and sentenced me for being guilty of serving righteousness. It&#39;s the worst thing that has ever happened to me and it&#39;s the best thing that has ever happened to me. I am no longer welcomed by my Earthly family but now I have been welcomed back into God&#39;s family. Thank you for disowning me for attempting to chasten you. It has sanctified me. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You convicted me for having Biblical values so I read the Bible and it&rsquo;s true. I have Biblical values. Thank you for proving that to me in a way that has the honesty that only an opponent could provide.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s make a comparison of worldviews so that you understand the choice you are making.

Relativism has no truth in it because it is just a plain philosophical idea. Nothing more than that. Because of this, the ground where Omnism, Syncretism, and Universalism fails. Therefore, they fail. They only posture a cute definition of truth but they have no truths in them because truth is founded on facts, not on the workings of the mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Truth cannot be manufactured in the mind by means of reasons. The mind can only define truth based on what it perceives from the outside but it cannot redefine or make truth by itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Truth stands even if no one believes it because it is based on facts and on events that actually took place.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father but by me&rdquo;. Now, it&rsquo;s just a matter of proving through facts whether He tells the truth or not. How can we do that?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ask yourself these three questions</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><ol class="c4 lst-kix_pb2ghbb337ir-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1 c2 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Did Jesus truly exist in history?

Then you must believe he is the only way. None among all the founders of world religions has ever said, &quot;I am the way&quot;. Only Jesus did and he proved it true by him raising himself from the dead. He said, &quot;destroy this temple (his body) and I will raise it up in three days.&quot; His claims were vindicated or proved to be right by his resurrection from the dead. May we find the truth</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you think people who do wrong deserve punishment? Have you ever done anything wrong? Doesn&#39;t that mean you deserve punishment? Jesus Christ is the only person in human history who has provided a way out of God&#39;s perfect judgment on our sin by substitutionary atonement. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you&#39;re brave enough to talk to me (or at least email me) I will be glad to answer any questions you have. You choose to run and hide from me but, I don&rsquo;t hide from you. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Try to resist the urge to have a stubborn indifference to what I&#39;m about to say. I know you are still trying to hide from me but, if you can understand what I&#39;m sharing with you it will change your lives.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>You might expect this letter to be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;overzealous or emotionally charged but it isn&#39;t. Let me give you an analogy before you read any further to demonstrate why this letter isn&rsquo;t irrational. Imagine walking down the street one night and you notice a family having dinner at home. How nice. But as you keep walking you notice that the roof of their house is on fire! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Immediately, y</span><span class="c0">ou begin to wave your arms but they try to ignore you. So then you start yelling &ldquo;fire!&rdquo; but they close their windows. You run to knock on their door in an attempt to save their lives from the deadly fire but they lock the front door and tell you to &ldquo;go away!&rdquo; Would you quit trying to warn that family that their house is on fire or would you desperately keep trying to save their lives and risk being offensive? Me too. I&rsquo;m going to risk being offensive to you. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>You are in danger. I&#39;ve asked all of you to repent from your sin and your response has been to judge me as deranged. You rejected my authority as your father and you have rejected what I offered you.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annika and Emme, I protected you when you were babies. Tera, I protected you while I was married to you. And so now, even though you have all disowned me, until you wake up I will continue to fight for you. One day you won&#39;t have to be the prodigal daughters anymore. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">None of you found joy in my attempt to chasten you. You love your sin. My advice is to pursue righteousness instead of pursuing happiness. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#8203;&#8203;Tera, one of your favorite authors, Richard Dawkins, is quoted in his most famous book &ldquo;The God Delusion&rdquo; that &ldquo;The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But what standard does Richard define God as unjust? He is stealing from God&rsquo;s biblical standard of morality of course. Richard Dawkins&rsquo; would have you believe that we are the product of random molecules bumping into each other for billions of years. He claims in his book that we are just &ldquo;moist robots&rdquo; or organic machines. His materialistic worldview does not allow for justice. Who would be the judge? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God didn&#39;t want robots when He created us. He gave us the freedom to choose to love Him or not. I will know that you have turned towards God when you turn towards forgiveness and call your Dad. Until then you are at enmity with God because contempt is a sin called &quot;murder of the heart.&quot; You are currently guilty of this sin towards me and God&#39;s perfect judgment awaits you unless you repent, which means to say you&#39;re sorry and then stop sinning. But we aren&#39;t very good at stopping sinning are we? That means we also need to trust in Christ Jesus as our savior from the penalty of our sin. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s important that you understand that moral relativism or subjective morality is not how things work. In reality we live by an objective moral standard written on our hearts, our conscience, which is the ten commandments given to us by God.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Richard Dawkins has to sit in God&rsquo;s lap before he can slap Him in the face! Right? You are doing the same thing. I&rsquo;m asking you to reconsider which side of the war you are on. Everybody has to pick a side. We are not all &ldquo;one.&rdquo; We are all two. We are either turning towards God or we are turning away from God. We are either at enmity with God or we are good with God.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There are only two choices. Which one do you choose?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Running away from home or running home</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Millions of pagan gods or the one true God</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Marriage as God forbids or marriage as God created</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Having sex as God forbids or having sex how God created</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karl Marx or George Washington</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joe Biden or Donald Trump</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">LGBT or The Bible</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worship creation or worship the Creator</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Satan or Christ </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is an invisible enemy and its sin. Unrepentant sin is like suicide because you are sending yourself to eternity without God. We call it hell. Unrighteous behavior will destroy your life. Instead of trying to elevate yourself, humble yourself. If you love God then you will find forgiveness.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s a famous story in the Bible from Genesis about Joseph and his brothers Genesis 50:20 &ldquo;You intended to harm me but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&rdquo; You intended to harm me by disowning me but what you have done has pushed me closer to Christ and so I thank you for that.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, I&rsquo;m not proud that you and I haven&#39;t been able to talk to each other but, it&rsquo;s important that we do. Perhaps this letter will be a step towards being able to talk again. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very difficult truths are about to be revealed (Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s black book, Hunter Biden&#39;s laptop) etc. Did you know that Anthony Keidis is on the flight logs to Epstein Island? We got mixed up with some sick people.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you haven&#39;t noticed yet, we are in the middle of a war. The Silent War. Everyone had to pick a side and I tried to warn you in 2018 but you wouldn&#39;t listen. You can join Joe Biden, LGBTQ, George Floyd, Ukrainian Nazis, Covid masks and vaccines, Abortion, Censorship, Satanism or you can join Trump and The Patriots, The Bible, The Constitution, America and Jesus. Only one side will win. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annika and Emme, don&#39;t ever get an abortion if you are ever faced with that situation. Life begins before conception. Abortion is murder, every time. You will be facing a terrible price for such a sin. I speak from experience. You aren&#39;t the first born in our family Annika. Your mom and I sacrificed our first born in a satanic ritual to Moloch. I repent Lord, have mercy on my soul. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Political events might get scary soon. I don&rsquo;t know what the event will be but, we will all know when we see it. We will likely see more riots too. The riots will look like Trump supporters are the ones rioting but it&rsquo;s actually Antifa and others trying to frame MAGA supporters. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the line dividing us is not political. This war is not between liberals and conservatives or Democrats versus Republicans. This war is between those who are turning towards Christ and those who are turning away from Christ. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Kabbalah is Babylonian mysticism. Babylon stands in opposition to God. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You might think that I am ashamed of being a &ldquo;QAnon&#39;&#39; and you might think that you have beat me. That&#39;s what the TV is trying very hard to convince you of being true. You may think that you are about to have Trump beat. Take a closer look. I&rsquo;m proud to be part of the greatest political movement in our lifetimes to save America and we are winning. You joined Joe Biden and you judged me as a MAGA terrorist but you&#39;re about to find out what a huge mistake you have made. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything that was done to try and stop Trump has failed. Nothing can stop what is coming. We are not just removing corrupt Democrats, we are reforming the entire corrupt system around the world. We are draining the swamp in Hollywood, the Healthcare Industry, FBI, Big Tech, corporate news media etc. It&rsquo;s Biblical.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You think your anger and contempt are justified because you are offended. You think your pride is a virtue. You&rsquo;re contempt and pride are sins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I know the media has told you to hate Q but in case you haven&#39;t figured it out yet &hellip; Trump and the United States military are Q. Q mentioned a verse from the Bible in 2017 that led me to read the Bible in its entirety and return back to Christ. It&rsquo;s Ephesians 6:11</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the tactics of the devil.

The battlefield is inside our living rooms. It&rsquo;s inside of us. The &ldquo;invisible enemy&rdquo; that Trump mentioned in his press conferences on COVID in 2020 over and over was not about the virus. He was telling us about the secret war against the Deep State. And the leader of the Deep State is Satan himself. Hold onto your hats. Satan is real. Jesus is real. And Satan and his Chinese Communist Party army have been attacking our families and our Judeo-Christian values using psychological warfare and pushing us into sin for decades. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy is not interested in biblical moral families. They are interested in installing brain dead and corruptible politicians to keep their evil agenda in place. The enemy talked our friends and family into sin which helped their agenda.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>But The Silent War is entering a new phase. </span><span class="c0">During the endgame in chess, there is a point where both Grandmasters know that it is mathematically impossible for one of the players to win. Usually the losing opponent has enough honor to resign. Right now we are watching an opponent (Joe Biden and company) that refuses to resign even though they have lost. If you believed CNN you think that your liberal friends have caught Trump but, things are not what they seem.

You can choose a mode of operation like your Dad and the power of forgiveness, or you can choose a mode of operation like your Mom and the power of contempt. You chose contempt. You chose The Left Hand Path. I&rsquo;m here to warn you about the consequences and ask that you repent and trust in Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Have you ever thought about what happens to us when we die? &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I&rsquo;m not writing to ask you for anything, I&rsquo;m offering you a warning. Tera, I&#39;ve paid my debt to you emotionally, physically, mentally and now financially but, I will always be your spiritual friend until the end. That&#39;s why I&rsquo;m offering you this gift of forgiveness again. I forgive you, do you forgive me? Now, do you agree that it&rsquo;s important that we teach our daughters how to do the same thing and choose forgiveness instead of contempt?</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During WWII the British were facing invasion by Satanic Nazis similar to today. It was a series of radio talks by author C.S. Lewis on the BBC radio that brought the nation back to God. Those radio talks were published as a book called &ldquo;Mere Christianity.&rdquo; If you were for some reason to doubt the validity of any claim that I am making in this letter then until we are able to speak in person, use this as a reference. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&#39;s a miracle that we exist as rational beings. Rationality is what makes sin possible. And sin is what makes salvation necessary. But you can&#39;t save yourself. It&rsquo;s satanic to even try. That was the original sin. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a sanctification process going on right now around the world. Every man, woman and child is being asked to choose a side in The Silent War. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If you aid and abet the enemy then you have to face the consequences of helping push sin and death on countless people. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&sect;903b.

Annika, you disowned me for not accepting your fornicating behavior. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are all offended by my biblical morality because you&#39;re afraid that it will take away something you really enjoy. Your sin. And it&rsquo;s almost always related to sex. For example, abortion, LGBTQIA+, adultery are all sins related to sex. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your nihilistic atheism is a religion and it is in direct opposition to the Bible. This war between these two religions is about morality and accountability. You chose the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t want there to be a God so you can keep sinning without consequence. You definitely don&rsquo;t want a Christian like me to impose Biblical morality on you, that way you can keep sinning without consequence.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You don&#39;t want your sin taken away. The enemy wants us divided. Sin is an easy way to do it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not claiming to be without sin. I&rsquo;m asking you to forgive me of my sin. I forgive you of yours. We all deserve hell. None of us deserve salvation and we are not in control of salvation. Buddhism teaches that we all have a &ldquo;basic goodness&rdquo; and that you can attain enlightenment through works. Christianity teaches that all of us sin and that God is in control of salvation.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All God has to do to send a person to hell is let them have what they want, to be without God. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Evil men want to be like gods. Christian men serve God. Man acts of his own fallen volition until he is set free by God to do what pleases God. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Salvation is totally an act of God instead of any of your supposed good deeds. Only Christ Jesus has power over sin and power over death. No one else has even claimed to have the power over death. If it were possible to get to heaven by being a good person then someone else could boast about it. But no one can. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is a gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. Ephesians 2:8</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You are offended by me because I do not tolerate sin. I had the courage to tell you to turn away from gay sex and fornication because I actually love you. This is also why the Bible is offensive to you. Because the ten commandments take the power of God away from your awesome self (sarcasm) and puts it back with God by exposing your sin. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of us sin. I&rsquo;m not judging you. I&rsquo;m not in charge of judgment, God is. I freely admit that I have broken every one of the ten commandments. What I&rsquo;m suggesting is that instead of being focused on your own happiness (because it&rsquo;s selfish and futile), I&rsquo;m asking you to focus on righteousness. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>If you can find Jesus you will find forgiveness and then you will call me. We can repeat these words to each other &ldquo;I forgive you. Do you forgive me?&rdquo; and then we can rebuild our relationship.

We stumbled into sin instead of willfully consenting into sin. Tera, just weeks after we had an abortion, the Mayan calendar became our religion. This was not an accident. The Mayan religion is built on human sacrifice. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even I was fooled into voting for Barack Obama in 2008 in hopes that he would fight the Deep State.

We used to sing these songs to Annika and Emme as babies while going to &ldquo;church&rdquo; in the red rocks every Sunday. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s what Bob Marley was trying to tell us in his reggae tune about the Bible ... it&#39;s not the wise that believe the gospel, it is the chosen! The predestined. The children at heart. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong - 1 Corinthians 1:27</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just finished reading the Bible and the entire thing can be summed up in eight words. Are you ready?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We broke the law. Jesus paid the fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Old Testament is about breaking God&rsquo;s law. For example, The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed because of homosexuality. Israel keeps disappointing God by worshiping idols. The Ten Commandments are a mirror that shows us our sin but there is no answer for how to atone for them.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The New Testament is about Christ dying for our sins. He paid the fine and The Judge can now let us go to heaven. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, I always assumed that even though we were both hurt by the church growing up that we both still loved Christ. I realize now that during our entire relationship I was always clinging to Christian values and trying to win you back to Christ and so this is my attempt again right now. Tera, will you repent and trust in Christ right now? To repent means to not only be sorry for your sins but also don&rsquo;t do them anymore. &ldquo;Trust in Christ&rdquo; means to trust that Jesus is who He says He is. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember when I told you Annika and Emme in 2018 in a car ride from Arcosanti Road that I trust in Christ as my personal Lord and Savior? You laughed at me. But I&rsquo;m asking both of you right now again. Will you repent and trust in Christ? Both of you stopped talking to me because I disciplined you with Biblical values but it was the right thing to do as your Dad. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The good news of the gospel is that punishment is on the way! The Heavenly Father punishes sin. That is good news! Your &ldquo;love is love&rdquo; philosophy that Barack Obama popularized in 2015 is evil because there is no punishment for sin. Just how a sinner likes it, right? No punishment? Sounds great. You can enjoy your sin and not have to deal with Dad. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But let&rsquo;s pretend for a moment that something awful like rape or murder happened to yourself or your children and the criminal was caught. Would you want a judge to tell that criminal &ldquo;love is love&rdquo; and then let him go free or do you want justice? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m sure that we all agree that we want justice. That criminal deserves life in prison or the death penalty for his heinous crimes. That is the predicament we are all in. God is the perfect judge and we will all face Him in the end. If you were to face God today would you be innocent or guilty of the Ten Commandments? Would you be going to heaven or hell? Does that concern you?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you stand in front of the judge are you going to tell him that you are a good person because of all the nice things you did like give $15 to the red cross that one time? The judge isn&#39;t interested in that. The judge has to deal with your crimes, not some flimsy good deeds you want credit for. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">People choose hell. What does that mean? Ask yourself if you are interested in forgiving others or have you only been able to find how to pursue your own interests? Are you interested in righteous forgiveness or selfish contempt? If you are only interested in yourself then God will say to you &ldquo;Okay. You want yourself, not me? All you want and love is yourself? Then have yourself. For the rest of eternity.&rdquo; People choose hell. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Repentance is all we have to avoid hell but so far none of you have chosen forgiveness. You chose contempt. You chose to disown me. You chose to judge me even though you have no right to judge. Which means judgment is what you will receive. But not from me. I forgave you already. You will receive judgment from God. This is why I&rsquo;m begging for you to repent for disowning me. Don&rsquo;t repent to me. Repent to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember the song &ldquo;One Love&rdquo; from Bob Marley? There is a line in the song that says &ldquo;There ain&#39;t no hiding place, from the Father of creation.&rdquo; What Bob is doing is quoting the Bible (Hebrews 4:13) and what this verse means is that all of us face judgment. I&rsquo;m trying to warn you of the danger you are in. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;m going to show us the x-rays with the situation we are all facing using The Ten Commandments. I am not judging you. God does the judging. I am showing us the x-rays of our sins. You&#39;re going to hate it but it&#39;s good for you, similar to going to the dentist.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, Annika and Emme, do you think you are a good person? Let&rsquo;s see if I can change your mind about that. Deepak Chopra, Nancy Pelosi and The New Age will tell you that you&rsquo;re a good person. Let&rsquo;s take a look. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">1</span><span class="c5">. Thou shalt have no other gods before me</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of us break this commandment first. We create our own version of God that doesn&rsquo;t hand out punishment for sin. It allows us to break all of the others because if we actually understood and feared the reality of the punishment of hell we would change our ways right away. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, you and I broke this commandment when we shopped around the New Age for any god or goddess that made us feel good about our sin. We created our own little god that doesn&#39;t hand out punishment for moral crimes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, if you look closely you will realize that even our most profound New Age experiences still all have Christ at the center. For example, all of those Bob Marley songs we sang to our kids and at drum circles are all about the Bible. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be forever loving Jah, Redemption Song, Exodus&rdquo; etc. Almost all of Bob Marley&rsquo;s songs are about the Bible. Tera, do you remember that time I bought you a Bible for your birthday? Do you still have it?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And remember, at the center of the Mayan Calendar is the 20th symbol, Ahau, or &ldquo;Christ Consciousness&rdquo;. We dedicated 20 good years of our life pursuing Christ Consciousness using the Tzolkin. Instead of serving Christ we were trying to be a Christ. That is Satanic because it&rsquo;s the promise that the devil made to Eve in Genesis. That is the original sin. Think about what I&rsquo;m saying.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Even your atheism is just an immature attempt to deny what you know is true, and that is that God wins. Glory to God! &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We thought that we were being &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; by playing around with New Age spirituality but sin made us stupid. Sun worship is worshiping creation not The Creator. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Karl Marx created a communist religion that promises that we will own nothing and be happy. It is a solution to get us back into the garden of Eden by control over humanity The Great Reset. This agenda uses people and then discards them in pursuit of a perfect society for them. We are near that point where either the enemy wins or we win total control of humanity and the entire world. They want a world where we don&#39;t even realize we are being controlled. Exact;y like Satan&rsquo;s greatest victory which was to convince many that he doesn&#39;t exist.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annika, the enemy has a method where they break a person or a nation by splitting them and then rebuild it back up how they want. You are being indoctrinated. Your ideology has been studied and interpreted into a Marxist Agenda, climate change, CRT. Ferber Method or Vanguardism. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Why is your left-wing inclusion philosophy not welcoming of Christians like me? How inclusive are you actually? Virtue signaling isn&#39;t actual virtue. This form of warfare has existed before but it&rsquo;s happening now in America now.We have God given rights. Only if you give up your rights can they win. (think masks) Consent or force. But force doesn&#39;t work. ESG is a forceful effort to seize the means of production as Karl Marx said.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy tried to accomplish this evil New World Order plan secretly but now it&rsquo;s been exposed. Now they become illegitimate. I&rsquo;m asking you to not be a part of the enemy&#39;s evil agenda. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, we are both victims of abuse by a cult. Jehovah Witness, the Catholic Church, Planet Art Network are all cults. You won&rsquo;t believe me but, I pray every morning that God will touch your heart and give you a path out of the New Age cult that is destroying everything in our lives and return back to Christ. Not for my sake but for yours. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By worshiping creation instead of the Creator we were led astray. All those times we worshiped the trees and the Earth and the Sun and the Moon instead of God, who created the trees and the Earth, we were committing the sin of idolatry.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, you didn&#39;t just betray our daughters by turning them against me, you didn&#39;t just betray me by destroying our family with your adultery, you didn&#39;t just betray the movement we dedicated our lives to destroy the illuminati, you betrayed yourself! You serve satan! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You may have noticed that the world is at war. There are only two sides in this war. Tera, you pushed our children into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. I saw the pictures of Annika and Emme dressed in Egyptian clothing and worshiping the sun. Do you understand the symbology you are playing with? It&rsquo;s satanic. Moses and Pharaoh don&rsquo;t mix. There are two sides in this war and you chose Pharoah. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did you push the COVID vaccine? Did you encourage the underage gay sex? Did you kneel down and worship George Floyd instead of Jesus? You broke the second commandment. These are all satanic rituals.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words &ldquo;satanic ritual&rdquo; was recently mentioned by Trump in an interview. You and all of your liberal friends are about to find out how you have been participating in satanic rituals pushed onto you by Satan worshippers like Nancy Pelosi and George Bush Jr. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We are witnessing a giant sting operation. It&rsquo;s a giant trap and you&#39;re about to get caught on the wrong side of the fence. I&rsquo;m trying to save you from being trapped with the satanic pedophiles nazis. Does that sound ridiculous? Buckle up. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, you remember our heroic attempt to leave the abuse in our childhoods by the Illuminati (The Deep State, The Cabal, The Left Hand Path etc.) in Kansas City and start a new family in Sedona? That was our battle to defeat The Cabal. You betrayed both vows that we took together. You betrayed the marriage vow to serve our family when you decided to be an adulterer. And you betrayed our spiritual vow to defeat the Cabal when you didn&#39;t defend our daughters from gay sex and other sin. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Remember, we got married on Dec 21, 1998 because we were fighting the illuminati and making a vow to the Mayan Calendar movement? You didn&#39;t even wait until 2012 to betray us. You divorced me before Dec 21, 2012. But I was able to continue the spiritual vow we made to find the truth. I found it. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life. No one comes before the Father except through Christ.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, do you remember all those nights at bookstores, studying mushrooms, mysticism and HTML? All of it was for this moment. The Satanic Cabal is being destroyed right before our eyes. I prayed it would happen in our lifetime. If you can understand what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you in this letter about repenting and trusting in Christ then you have a chance to switch to the winning side before it&rsquo;s too late. There will be hell to pay and it&rsquo;s arriving fast.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took The Bodhisattva Vow in 1992. &ldquo;I will attain the immortal, undecaying, pain-free Bodhi, and free the world from all pain.&rdquo; I was as godless as you could get. I speak from experience when I say that this path is a dead end. Only through Christ is there redemption. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Being liberal used to mean standing against globalization and corporate media. Remember the WTO riots in Seattle in 1999? Rage Against The Machine? Now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;put your mask on.&rdquo; I was banned from Twitter in 2020 at the same time as President Trump because I said masks don&rsquo;t work. Did you know that masks don&#39;t stop viruses? A history book would have told you that. I hope you didn&#39;t wear a mask. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>During peak COVID in June 2020 I was on vacation at NASA and Disneyworld in Orlando, Florida. I rode the Harry Potter Motorbike roller coaster three times because there was no line. I also turned down an offer from Facebook in 2021 for a UX Designer job because Zuckerberg is a Satanist. I no longer worship false idols. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This commandment means more than just it&rsquo;s not polite to say &ldquo;OMG.&rdquo; It means that it is a sin to not represent God&rsquo;s family name with honor. We are a part of God&rsquo;s family and we have His last name to represent. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everything in this world can be described as trying to lead us towards Christ or away from Christ. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Look closer. Everything is about Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. You are either in defiance or you are in servitude to that objective truth. Right now you are in defiance and the penalty is eternal damnation. You are not representing God&rsquo;s family name. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I&rsquo;m warning all of you that j</span><span class="c0">udgment is about to arrive in America. The 2020 Presidential Election was stolen. The Deep State is real. Our families have been under attack by something called &ldquo;irregular warfare&rdquo; or low intensity conflict which is a form of infiltration instead of invasion. This form of warfare includes brainwashing our kids with gender pronouns instead of attacking us with tanks. COVID vaccine injuries instead of nuclear missiles. Election fraud instead of fighter jets. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told you and Annika and Emme to not get that COVID vaccine. Now you are at high risk for infertility, heart problems, immune deficiency syndromes and more. Tera, did you push the COVID vaccine on Emme? Repent. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>It&rsquo;s Maricopa County voters like me that are leading the charge to expose election fraud from 2020. I&rsquo;ve been part of the Q movement from the very beginning in 2017 and I am on a first name basis with almost every top Anon in the Q community. I have compiled years of information to prove every claim I&rsquo;m making in this letter. I will share that information with you if you are interested when you call me.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, we moved to beautiful Sedona, Arizona to be holy but we couldn&#39;t find time to go to church or put God at the center of our family and marriage. I regret that. Instead we &ldquo;communed with nature&rdquo; on Sunday. We needed church. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I meant what I said, Annika and Emme, when I said in my last letter to you in 2019 that a marriage between a man and a woman is &ldquo;divine.&rdquo; Everything else is a perversion and a sin. And just because you&#39;ve let your sin warp the rest of your life doesn&#39;t make it not a sin. There is nothing but pain and destruction if you continue any sinful lifestyle including homosexuality and that&#39;s why I told you that &ldquo;it&#39;s a phase.&rdquo; You will eventually be destroyed by the sin. No one escapes the penalty of sin, have you figured that out yet? Buddhism has no answer on how to atone for your sin. I want something better for my daughter than a life destroyed by sin.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The new popular view of homosexuality is that it&rsquo;s noble because you are being yourself. The biblical view is that homosexuality is a perverse sex act and that&#39;s it. Just like any other sin a person needs to be saved from sin. I confronted you on your sin Emme because I actually love you. Your Mom and your big sister push you into sin. It&rsquo;s called grooming and it&rsquo;s evil. Why would I try to make you feel better about your unchecked lust? I&rsquo;m your father, I am going to protect you. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You might say &ldquo;I was born gay&rdquo; and that would be correct. I was born a sinner too. We all were. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emme, you were influenced by teachers, tumblr, your Mom, your big sister, basically anybody that wasn&#39;t me to be gay. That is how the enemy works, it needed to remove my protection as your father and then influence you while you were vulnerable into sin. It worked. Putting a 10 year old kid in a immorally sexualized environment like you were when your Mom ran off with another man and the influence of your gay teachers at school, gay TV, your big sister&rsquo;s sinful gay sex all &ldquo;groomed&rdquo; hou into even more sin. I tried to get you out of it in 2018. I&rsquo;m still trying to get you out of it now. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emme, I&rsquo;m asking you to repent and return back to biblical values. Annika, you can&#39;t drink that Satanic kool-aid fast enough even though I told you to use critical thinking. Know your enemy! Remember? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The enemy is trying to steal you from me and from Christ using the school system, movies, social justice politics, gay sex and sin. It&rsquo;s my job as your father and head of this broken household to protect you. You were attacked by military grade psychological warfare techniques to turn against me. Does that sound preposterous? Keep reading this letter and you will see how sane my statement is. CRT is Marxism. Marxism is not Biblical. You have all chosen to stand against God, the consequences are very high because God&rsquo;s judgment is real. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. - Proverbs 9:10</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pagan approach that your Mom teaches to finding the will of God is to circumvent the mind, or to turn off the mind, to not trust the mind, transcend the mind etc. with meditation, ritual or technology. Tarot cards, tea leaves, meditation, palm reading, astrology until you have an ecstatic feeling. You get high off it. This is called mysticism or anti-intellectualism. Sometimes it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;finding inner peace.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s conceited because it does not account for sin.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The biblical approach to finding the will of God is the exact opposite because it is through the mind that we find the will of God, not pushing the mind to the side in a relaxed state. We use reason and evidence.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Emme, when I was compelled by the will of God, as defined by scripture, to tell you to turn away from homosexual sin I was not &ldquo;experiencing inner peace&rdquo; like some kind of vacation in Sedona. I was risking it all to do the right thing because I want you to have the best in this life and the next. Do you see the difference? Any friend could condone your sin but someone like your father who truly wants the best for you will confront your sin. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Atone for your sin and you will have actual peace. Ask for forgiveness for yourself and your Dad and you can have peace. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course you didn&rsquo;t like it when I confronted your sin because you wanted to get away with it. Criminals never seem to find any cops because they aren&#39;t looking for any. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now you don&#39;t trust God&rsquo;s wisdom. You trust your own wisdom instead. You&#39;re not obedient to God. You are obedient to yourself as a god. There is some power in that but it&#39;s not anything you want to be involved in. You&rsquo;ve been convinced that God is some kind of bully in the sky because he wont allow you to have underage gay sex. The truth is He is a father trying to protect his children. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moral relativity. You think because you like gay sex that you deserve special privileges or rights. Such as the right to disown your father if you want. You chose temptation and woke ideologies instead of truth. You chose subjective reality instead of objective reality. You chose Satan&rsquo;s word instead of God&#39;s word. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You chose insolence instead of giving me respect. There is a penalty for your crime. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stephanie is a godly woman. We are getting married on November 19th at church and it&rsquo;s the right thing to do to show her and I the respect of being there.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I honor the sabbath now by attending Dream City Church every Sunday. Charlie Kirk is a member of my congregation, you know him right? I know you follow politics. Trump visited Dream City Church because of Charlie Kirk&rsquo;s Christian student organization called Turning Point USA. Would you like to go to church with me Emme? Want to try something real instead of the sick stuff you&#39;ve been mixed up in?</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your men will fall by the sword because they have become weak. Deserted, she will sit on the ground. Isaiah 3:26 The woman conquered her own protectors. It&rsquo;s a sin. Tera you destroyed your best protector, your husband. Annika anD Emme you destroyed your best protector, your father. When you are conquered you can sit there deserted. Weak men make everybody vulnerable to danger. That&#39;s what this country is going through. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If the women and children are in charge then we are in trouble. The divine order is God, then dad, then mom, then the children. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your sin is a prison right now but, soo it will be a tomb. I&rsquo;m asking you to choose God instead of darkness. I&rsquo;m asking you to repent not because I want to win an argument with you. I am trying to save you. I love you enough to tell you the truth.

Honor thy father and thy mother</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, you have taught our daughters to disown their father. This is a terrible sin. Tell our daughters to call me. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A marriage is between a man and woman and God. When I told Annika and Emme that having a family is &ldquo;divine&rdquo; in my letter in 2019 Annika said she laughed out loud and told me I&rsquo;m guilty of &ldquo;emotional incest.&rdquo; How much do you hate God Annika? You are brave enough to hate God that much after a couple community college classes, I can&#39;t imagine how self-righteous you are after getting a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Portland State University. Judeo-Christian values were attacked by a satanic and comminust force in our schools and you were part of it. We all were. But everything is about to change. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tera, you chose to side with Joe Biden and the pedophiles and instead of letting me give Emme $10k to enroll in ASU you pushed her into gay sex. Emme, you were told that I&rsquo;m being homphobic. The truth is that I am handing out discipline. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Annika, when I told you that Mario is not allowed to stay overnight at your apartment you lied to me. The truth is that I was handing out discipline.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">6. Thou shalt not murder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The abortion was the worst decision we have ever made in our life. I have asked God for forgiveness many times. Have you repented? Do you still support abortion? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But Annika and Emme, you are guilty of &ldquo;murder in the heart.&rdquo; By keeping grudges and holding contempt in your heart your anger is a terrible sin. God&rsquo;s wrath is being stored up against you every day that you don&rsquo;t reach out to me and tell me that you are okay. For your own sake, stop holding grudges. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">7. Thou shalt not commit adultery</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I didn&rsquo;t commit adultery. I took the vow I made to &ldquo;have and to hold until death do us part&rdquo; very seriously. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tera, on your 18th birthday you told me that you wanted to be a stripper. I told you that the only way I&#39;m going along with this is if we use the money to get back to Sedona. The stripping wasn&#39;t the sin, it was the adultery. We were supposed to stay faithful to each other and our cause to defeat the 12:60 Illuminati. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you have the courage to be honest with me now and admit how many times you cheated on our marriage? You know it&rsquo;s a sin, is that why you can&#39;t admit it to me? If you don&rsquo;t think it was a sin then why not just admit it to me? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only are you unable to confess the truth about your infidelity, you even attempted to convince our daughters that I was guilty of adultery against you. Evil stuff. Now I know that It was my Christian morals that wouldn&#39;t allow me to cheat on you. I am however guilty of &ldquo;adultery of the heart&rdquo; because I tried to sexualize the pain you put me through with your cheating. I was behaving like a masochist. Not a cuck, not a pimp. Being masochistic was my unhealthy way of dealing with your sadistic nature. You can&#39;t have one without the other. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What we were really doing was asking ourselves by going along with all of the adultery (or adultery of the heart) was how much sin can we do and get away with it? The answer was we got away with nothing. Our marriage didn&#39;t have God at the center and it was destroyed just like anything else that turns away from God. I repent Lord on behalf of both of us. Have mercy on us for not running away from lust. The flesh is weak. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shame might be your heart telling you to stop sinning and there is a God who will forgive you. Repent means stopping the sinful behavior. God knows your name and He cares about you. Instead of being nice I spoke the truth. Truth is truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">8. Thou shalt not steal</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are all guilty of stealing. Some more than others. Tera, you have stolen good years of my life that my daughters and I could have had together by convincing them to disown me. When you stand in front of a perfect and just God on judgment day how will you explain encouraging your daughters to estrange their father? </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">9. Thou shalt not lie</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We are all guilty of lying. Some of us lie more than others. We were able to commit all of the other sins on this list by lying. I was very strict with you Annika about lying to me because as I explained back in 2018, I am trying to build a real relationship based on trust and respect. You may not have figured out that truth yet but, I&rsquo;m here for you when you do. Repent. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5">10. Thou shalt not want</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a sinful desire in women to WANT to dominate the husband. The Bible is very clear about this in Genesis 3. It says the man has to rule over the woman&#39;s urge to control the household. God first, the man second, the wife third and the children last. Because we allowed the children to run the household our household is broken.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of you pride yourself on dominating men but it&#39;s a sin that has very high consequences. I am still the head of this household whether you want to pretend I am or not and that is why I am telling you the truth whether you want to hear it or whether you can even understand it yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;m not judging you. I have sinned too. We are all sinful in nature. What I&rsquo;m doing is begging you to repent and trust in Jesus Christ. It&rsquo;s the only way.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isaiah 64:6 says that &ldquo;all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our good deeds are not going to save us. All religions except Christianity torture you by convincing you that youre a good person, denying your sinful nature, and then telling you that your good deeds will bring you salvation. It&rsquo;s a trap! Even though we broke all ten commandments and face an eternity in hell there is salvation if we repent and trust that Jesus is who he says he is. The Great Redeemer. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You may have noticed that we are in a war. A Silent war that is spiritual in nature. You picked the wrong side and you lost. Trea, you pushed our kids down the wrong path. I tried to warn you with my last letter to choose forgiveness instead of contempt. The stakes are very high. Heaven or hell. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve read your Twitter feed. It&rsquo;s embarrassing to watch you kneel down to George Floyd, with your mask on, getting double vaxxed, calling Donald Trump dumb, calling Devin Nunes dumb, calling Wendy Rogers dumb, calling Kari Lake dumb. Consider this letter an attempt to red pill you. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Stephanie and I got married on November 19, 2022. Here is our wedding website with photos </span><span class="c8"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theknot.com/us/stephanie-leiferman-and-adam-klaasmeyer-nov-2022&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1687384181954330&amp;usg=AOvVaw2kWhxbXf1p_u8ykEYrhhel">https://www.theknot.com/us/stephanie-leiferman-and-adam-klaasmeyer-nov-2022</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You likely already received the &ldquo;Save the Date&rdquo; and the invitation and you obviously all chose not to even reply with a decline.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same people who stole our election are the same people who control the global child sex trafficking network (My church is the leader in fighting against this crime by the way by providing safe houses for human trafficking victims) These are the same people you want to vote for in November like Katie Hobbs. These are the same people who destroyed our lives with COVID and the vaccine and the same people who destroyed our economy with inflation. The same people who worship Satan are the same people you vote for and use for moral guidance in your house. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You aided and embedded the enemy.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tera, </span><span class="c0">I was trying to clothe you in righteousness and dignity for the 12 years I was married to you. That&#39;s why I gave you Sedona and two beautiful daughters. You paid me back by attempting to use it all to try and destroy me. It didn&rsquo;t work. I forgive you. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I&rsquo;m trying to help you. But I can&#39;t help you by sending money anymore so now I&rsquo;m here trying to help you by telling you to find Jesus. We all win if you do. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trust that Jesus is who he says he is. Trust in Jesus like you trust a parachute to work. I&rsquo;ve tried to put the fear of God in you for five minutes so that you will see how important it is to find forgiveness. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Choose the right side of the war. The sooner you switch sides in this war the better it will be for you. Do you ever think about what happens after you die? Do you ever think about karmic justice? I&rsquo;ve just explained to you how you can atone for your sins. Repent and trust in Jesus Christ. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>And then, Annika and Emme, call your Dad.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Download a copy of this letter at </span><span class="c8"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEgOjeU2StNCnXpZ_-QemI-RXakdRPAGLq7tMtmAaLM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1687384181955977&amp;usg=AOvVaw37WAIEpwOfRVkv7O-fJyqJ">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zEgOjeU2StNCnXpZ_-QemI-RXakdRPAGLq7tMtmAaLM/edit?usp=sharing</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">///</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Songs that I used to sing to my daughters when they were babies &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">oh Annika Annika oh Annika, daddy&rsquo;s baby girl, oh Annika oh Annika, best baby girl in the world! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my emme my emme where she goes we go. </span></p></body></html>
